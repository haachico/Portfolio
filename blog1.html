      <h1 class="margin-btm">1. A small blog on Let, Const and Var.</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Let , Const, and Var</strong> are three ways of declaring the
        variables in Javascript. All are similar except for a few differences. I
        will talk about some simple differences below and will tell which is
        more advisable to use.
        <br />

        <strong> Let</strong> - Let was introduced in ES6. It's almost similar
        to Var. It is a modern way of declaring variables the values of which
        are not fixedâ€”and are likely to change in the future. In other words, we
        use let for mutating the variables. In Let, hosting is allowed. Let is a block scope. That means, the variable decalraed can be accesssed only within the block ('{}') in which it is declared and within the block of its parent element.<br />
        <strong> Const</strong> - Const was also introduced in ES6 along with
        Let. It is also a modern way of declaring the variables. It's used to
        declare variables the values of which are likely to remain fixed in the
        future. For eg, Birthyear. We use const when we are sure that values
        won't change once declared. In Const, hosting is not allowed.  Const is also a block scope. <br />
        <strong>Var</strong> - Var is old way of declaring variables. That is,
        prior to ES6, before const and var was introduced. It's pretty similar
        to Let. In Var, hosting is allowed. Unlike Let and Const, Var is a function scope. That means, the variable declared with var can be acsessed anywhere within the function in which it is declared. <br />
        <p style="margin-top: 3rem">
          <strong>Conclusion</strong> - As a best practice, always use const. And if
          you are sure that the value of a variable is going to change in the future
          then use Let. It is a good practice to use as little variable mutations as possible
          because changing variable creates more potential for bugs in the
          code.</p>
